# Analysis Report

# Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to build and optimize a deep learning model to predict the success of charity applications. This involves preprocessing the data, selecting appropriate features and targets, building a neural network, and attempting to optimize its performance.

# Results
Data Preprocessing:

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
    Target Variable:

    IS_SUCCESSFUL: Indicates whether a charity application was successful (binary classification: 1 for success, 0 for failure).

What variable(s) are the features for your model?
    Feature Variables:

    APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT.

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
    Variables Removed:

    EIN and NAME were dropped as they are identifiers with no predictive value for the model.

# Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

    Details about the architecture will be extracted. Typically, choices are:
    Input layer corresponding to the number of features.
    One or more hidden layers with neurons optimized based on experimentation.
    Activation functions such as ReLU for hidden layers and Sigmoid for binary classification output.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

    Analyze the performance metric (e.g., accuracy or loss) achieved on the test set.
    If target performance was not met, highlight optimization attempts.

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

    Examples of optimization steps:
    Adjusting the number of neurons or layers.
    Changing activation functions or the learning rate.
    Using dropout layers to reduce overfitting.

# Summary
The model performance summary will include:

Overall results (accuracy, loss, etc.).
Limitations of the current approach.
Recommendation for alternative models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) with reasoning (e.g., feature importance evaluation, handling of non-linear relationships).
