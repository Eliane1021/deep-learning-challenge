# Analysis Report

# Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to build and optimize a deep learning model to predict the success of charity applications. This involves preprocessing the data, selecting appropriate features and targets, building a neural network, and attempting to optimize its performance.

# Results
Data Preprocessing:

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
    Target Variable:

    IS_SUCCESSFUL: Indicates whether a charity application was successful (binary classification: 1 for success, 0 for failure).

What variable(s) are the features for your model?
    Feature Variables:

    APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT.

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
    Variables Removed:

    EIN and NAME were dropped as they are identifiers with no predictive value for the model.

# Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

    Model Architecture:

    Layers: 3 dense layers
    Neurons: 3 layers with unspecified numbers of neurons per layer.
    Activation Functions: All layers used ReLU activation.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

    The model's loss and accuracy were evaluated, but specific performance metrics were not explicitly provided in the notebook.

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

    No specific steps to improve model performance were documented in the notebook.

# Summary
The deep learning model provides a starting point for classifying successful charity applications but may require optimization to improve accuracy and reliability. A potential next step would be to:

Implement techniques such as hyperparameter tuning (adjusting neurons, layers, and learning rates).
Experiment with different architectures or alternative models, such as random forest classifiers or gradient boosting, which may offer better performance for tabular data.
